Tabs for hide content if you dont need this

With this code, we can hide content that we don't need to display( so as not to clutter the page). 
When you click on certain tabs, the desired content appears, and the rest is hidden.

The tab,info, and tabContent variables are passed elements from the page with certain classes. 
The 'info' variable is the parent of 'info-header-tab'. The Functions used by the classes .CSS file. 
You can replace them with style.display = flex(none).
